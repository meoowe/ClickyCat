On the tropical island of Mauritius, lived a weak and feeble cat, just waiting for motivation. The name of this cat, Clicky. One day, Clicky heard a knock at his door. When he answered, he saw an old cat ,which he would soon find out was named Loki. He offered to be Clicky‚Äôs sensei and make him a truly strong cat. Clicky willingly agreed and from the first training session, Loki noticed his potential. He could see Clicky one day becoming the best of the best but knew that he needed much work. Your first objective, climb Le Pouce, a well known mountain in the area.
